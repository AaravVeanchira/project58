        <p class="para"My hobby is playing badminton. I go for badminton coaching in the evening.i love badminton very much and play it with my friends in weekends. My inspirations in badminton are Saina Nehwal ,Pullela Gopichand and Lee Chong Wei. I started playing badminton when i was 7 years old. I have won several by winning in the tournaments held. It keeps me fit healthy and i fell refreshing after my badminton sessions.
